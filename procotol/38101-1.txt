4	General

41	Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements

The present document is a SingleRAT specification for NR UE covering RF characteristics and minimum performance requirements Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the test requirements specified in the conformance specification 3GPP TS 385211 4 

The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for measurement uncertainty The test specification TS 385211 4 defines test tolerances These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements in this specification to create test requirements For some requirements including regulatory requirements the test tolerance is set to zero

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared  without any modification  against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk principle 

The shared risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITUR M1545 5

42	Applicability of minimum requirements

a	In this specification the Minimum Requirements are specified as general requirements and additional requirements Where the Requirement is specified as a general requirement the requirement is mandated to be met in all scenarios 

b	For specific scenarios for which an additional requirement is specified in addition to meeting the general requirement the UE is mandated to meet the additional requirements

c	The spurious emissions power requirements are for the longterm average of the power For the purpose of reducing measurement uncertainty it is acceptable to average the measured power over a period of time sufficient to reduce the uncertainty due to the statistical nature of the signal

5	Operating bands and channel arrangement

51	General

The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the operating bands and channel bandwidths defined in the present release of specifications

NOTE	Other operating bands and channel bandwidths may be considered in future releases

Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined separately for different frequency ranges FR The frequency ranges in which NR can operate according to this version of the specification are identified as described in Table 511

54	Channel Arrangement

541	Channel Spacing

5411	Channel spacing for adjacent NR carriers

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario the size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR carriers is defined as following

Nominal Channel spacing  BWChannel1  BWChannel22 ¡À5kHz

where BWChannel1 and BWChannel2 are the channel bandwidths of the two respective NR carriers The channel spacing can be adjusted depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario

5412	Channel Spacing for CA

Editors note Detailed structure of the subclause is TBD

542	Channel Raster

5421	Channel Raster and Numbering

The channel raster defines a set of RF reference frequencies that are used to identify the RF channel position The RF reference frequency for an RF channel maps to a resource element on the carrier

A global frequency raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz and is used to define the set of allowed RF reference frequencies The granularity of the global frequency raster is ¦¤FGlobal For each operating band a subset of frequencies from the global frequency raster are applicable for that band and forms a channel raster for that band with a granularity ¦¤FRaster which may be equal to or larger than ¦¤FGlobal  

The RF reference frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number NRARFCN in the range 0 2016666 on the global frequency raster The relation between the NRARFCN and the RF reference frequency FREF in MHz for the downlink and uplink is given by the following equation where FREFOffs and NRefOffs are given in table 54211 and NREF is the NRARFCN

641	Frequency error

The UE modulated carrier frequency shall be accurate to within ¡À01 PPM observed over a period of TBD compared to the carrier frequency received from the NR Node B

642	Transmit modulation quality

Transmit modulation quality defines the modulation quality for expected inchannel RF transmissions from the UE The transmit modulation quality is specified in terms of

	Carrier leakage

	Inband emissions for the nonallocated RB

All the parameters defined in subclause 642 are defined using the measurement methodology specified in Annex F

6421	Error Vector Magnitude

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform and the measured waveform This difference is called the error vector Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset Then the carrier leakage  shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the EVM

The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and absolute amplitude of the Tx chain The EVM result is defined after the frontend IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a 

The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble sequence for the PRACH and is one slot for the PUCCH and PUSCH in the time domain When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS the EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol accordingly The PUSCH or PUCCH EVM measurement interval is also reduced when the mean power modulation or allocation between slots is expected to change In the case of PUSCH transmission the measurement interval is reduced by a time interval equal to the sum of 5 ¦Ìs and the applicable exclusion period defined in subclause 63X adjacent to the boundary where the power change is expected to occur For DFTspread PUSCH the  exclusion period is applied to the signal obtained after the frontend IDFT In the case of PUCCH transmission with power change the PUCCH EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol adjacent to the boundary where the power change is expected to occur

6422	Carrier leakage

Carrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform whose frequency is the same as the modulated waveform carrier frequency The measurement interval is one slot in the time domain

In the case that uplink sharing the carrier leakage may have 75kHz shift with the carrier frequency

6423	Inband emissions

The inband emission is defined as the average emission across 12 subcarriers and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of the allocated UL transmission bandwidth The inband emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output power in a nonallocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB

The basic inband emissions measurement interval is defined over one slot in the time domain however the minimum requirement applies when the inband emission measurement is averaged over 10 subframes When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS the inband emissions measurement interval is reduced by one or more symbols accordingly

6424	EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

The zeroforcing equalizer correction applied in the EVM measurement process as described in Annex F must meet a spectral flatness requirement for the EVM measurement to be valid The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is defined in terms of the maximum peaktopeak ripple of the equalizer coefficients dB across the allocated uplink block The basic measurement interval is the same as for EVM

Note 2 These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB MHz in Table 65311 and Table xxxxx from the edge of the channel bandwidth





654	Transmit intermodulation

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna

UE transmit intermodulation is defined by the ratio of the mean power of the wanted signal to the mean power of the intermodulation product when an interfering CW signal is added at a level below the wanted signal at each transmitter antenna port with the other antenna ports if any terminated Both the wanted signal power and the intermodulation product power are measured through NR rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth shown in Table 6541

The requirement of transmit intermodulation is specified in Table 6541

4	General

41	Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements

The present document is a SingleRAT specification for NR UE covering RF characteristics and minimum performance requirements Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the test requirements specified in the conformance specification 3GPP TS 385211 4 

The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for measurement uncertainty The test specification TS 385211 4 defines test tolerances These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements in this specification to create test requirements For some requirements including regulatory requirements the test tolerance is set to zero

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared  without any modification  against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk principle 

The shared risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITUR M1545 5

42	Applicability of minimum requirements

a	In this specification the Minimum Requirements are specified as general requirements and additional requirements Where the Requirement is specified as a general requirement the requirement is mandated to be met in all scenarios 

b	For specific scenarios for which an additional requirement is specified in addition to meeting the general requirement the UE is mandated to meet the additional requirements

c	The spurious emissions power requirements are for the longterm average of the power For the purpose of reducing measurement uncertainty it is acceptable to average the measured power over a period of time sufficient to reduce the uncertainty due to the statistical nature of the signal

5	Operating bands and channel arrangement

51	General

The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the operating bands and channel bandwidths defined in the present release of specifications

NOTE	Other operating bands and channel bandwidths may be considered in future releases

Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined separately for different frequency ranges FR The frequency ranges in which NR can operate according to this version of the specification are identified as described in Table 511

54	Channel Arrangement

541	Channel Spacing

5411	Channel spacing for adjacent NR carriers

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario the size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR carriers is defined as following

Nominal Channel spacing  BWChannel1  BWChannel22 ¡À5kHz

where BWChannel1 and BWChannel2 are the channel bandwidths of the two respective NR carriers The channel spacing can be adjusted depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario

5412	Channel Spacing for CA

Editors note Detailed structure of the subclause is TBD

542	Channel Raster

5421	Channel Raster and Numbering

The channel raster defines a set of RF reference frequencies that are used to identify the RF channel position The RF reference frequency for an RF channel maps to a resource element on the carrier

A global frequency raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz and is used to define the set of allowed RF reference frequencies The granularity of the global frequency raster is ¦¤FGlobal For each operating band a subset of frequencies from the global frequency raster are applicable for that band and forms a channel raster for that band with a granularity ¦¤FRaster which may be equal to or larger than ¦¤FGlobal  

The RF reference frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number NRARFCN in the range 0 2016666 on the global frequency raster The relation between the NRARFCN and the RF reference frequency FREF in MHz for the downlink and uplink is given by the following equation where FREFOffs and NRefOffs are given in table 54211 and NREF is the NRARFCN

641	Frequency error

The UE modulated carrier frequency shall be accurate to within ¡À01 PPM observed over a period of TBD compared to the carrier frequency received from the NR Node B

642	Transmit modulation quality

Transmit modulation quality defines the modulation quality for expected inchannel RF transmissions from the UE The transmit modulation quality is specified in terms of

	Carrier leakage

	Inband emissions for the nonallocated RB

All the parameters defined in subclause 642 are defined using the measurement methodology specified in Annex F

6421	Error Vector Magnitude

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform and the measured waveform This difference is called the error vector Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset Then the carrier leakage  shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the EVM

The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and absolute amplitude of the Tx chain The EVM result is defined after the frontend IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a 

The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble sequence for the PRACH and is one slot for the PUCCH and PUSCH in the time domain When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS the EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol accordingly The PUSCH or PUCCH EVM measurement interval is also reduced when the mean power modulation or allocation between slots is expected to change In the case of PUSCH transmission the measurement interval is reduced by a time interval equal to the sum of 5 ¦Ìs and the applicable exclusion period defined in subclause 63X adjacent to the boundary where the power change is expected to occur For DFTspread PUSCH the  exclusion period is applied to the signal obtained after the frontend IDFT In the case of PUCCH transmission with power change the PUCCH EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol adjacent to the boundary where the power change is expected to occur

6422	Carrier leakage

Carrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform whose frequency is the same as the modulated waveform carrier frequency The measurement interval is one slot in the time domain

In the case that uplink sharing the carrier leakage may have 75kHz shift with the carrier frequency

6423	Inband emissions

The inband emission is defined as the average emission across 12 subcarriers and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of the allocated UL transmission bandwidth The inband emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output power in a nonallocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB

The basic inband emissions measurement interval is defined over one slot in the time domain however the minimum requirement applies when the inband emission measurement is averaged over 10 subframes When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS the inband emissions measurement interval is reduced by one or more symbols accordingly

6424	EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

The zeroforcing equalizer correction applied in the EVM measurement process as described in Annex F must meet a spectral flatness requirement for the EVM measurement to be valid The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is defined in terms of the maximum peaktopeak ripple of the equalizer coefficients dB across the allocated uplink block The basic measurement interval is the same as for EVM

Note 2 These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB MHz in Table 65311 and Table xxxxx from the edge of the channel bandwidth





654	Transmit intermodulation

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna

UE transmit intermodulation is defined by the ratio of the mean power of the wanted signal to the mean power of the intermodulation product when an interfering CW signal is added at a level below the wanted signal at each transmitter antenna port with the other antenna ports if any terminated Both the wanted signal power and the intermodulation product power are measured through NR rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth shown in Table 6541

The requirement of transmit intermodulation is specified in Table 6541

4	General

41	Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements

The present document is a SingleRAT specification for NR UE covering RF characteristics and minimum performance requirements Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling the test requirements specified in the conformance specification 3GPP TS 385211 4 

The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for measurement uncertainty The test specification TS 385211 4 defines test tolerances These test tolerances are individually calculated for each test The test tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements in this specification to create test requirements For some requirements including regulatory requirements the test tolerance is set to zero

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared  without any modification  against the test requirements as defined by the shared risk principle 

The shared risk principle is defined in Recommendation ITUR M1545 5

42	Applicability of minimum requirements

a	In this specification the Minimum Requirements are specified as general requirements and additional requirements Where the Requirement is specified as a general requirement the requirement is mandated to be met in all scenarios 

b	For specific scenarios for which an additional requirement is specified in addition to meeting the general requirement the UE is mandated to meet the additional requirements

c	The spurious emissions power requirements are for the longterm average of the power For the purpose of reducing measurement uncertainty it is acceptable to average the measured power over a period of time sufficient to reduce the uncertainty due to the statistical nature of the signal

5	Operating bands and channel arrangement

51	General

The channel arrangements presented in this clause are based on the operating bands and channel bandwidths defined in the present release of specifications

NOTE	Other operating bands and channel bandwidths may be considered in future releases

Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases defined separately for different frequency ranges FR The frequency ranges in which NR can operate according to this version of the specification are identified as described in Table 511

54	Channel Arrangement

541	Channel Spacing

5411	Channel spacing for adjacent NR carriers

The spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario the size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR carriers is defined as following

Nominal Channel spacing  BWChannel1  BWChannel22 ¡À5kHz

where BWChannel1 and BWChannel2 are the channel bandwidths of the two respective NR carriers The channel spacing can be adjusted depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario

5412	Channel Spacing for CA

Editors note Detailed structure of the subclause is TBD

542	Channel Raster

5421	Channel Raster and Numbering

The channel raster defines a set of RF reference frequencies that are used to identify the RF channel position The RF reference frequency for an RF channel maps to a resource element on the carrier

A global frequency raster is defined for all frequencies from 0 to 100 GHz and is used to define the set of allowed RF reference frequencies The granularity of the global frequency raster is ¦¤FGlobal For each operating band a subset of frequencies from the global frequency raster are applicable for that band and forms a channel raster for that band with a granularity ¦¤FRaster which may be equal to or larger than ¦¤FGlobal  

The RF reference frequency in the uplink and downlink is designated by the NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number NRARFCN in the range 0 2016666 on the global frequency raster The relation between the NRARFCN and the RF reference frequency FREF in MHz for the downlink and uplink is given by the following equation where FREFOffs and NRefOffs are given in table 54211 and NREF is the NRARFCN

641	Frequency error

The UE modulated carrier frequency shall be accurate to within ¡À01 PPM observed over a period of TBD compared to the carrier frequency received from the NR Node B

642	Transmit modulation quality

Transmit modulation quality defines the modulation quality for expected inchannel RF transmissions from the UE The transmit modulation quality is specified in terms of

	Carrier leakage

	Inband emissions for the nonallocated RB

All the parameters defined in subclause 642 are defined using the measurement methodology specified in Annex F

6421	Error Vector Magnitude

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the reference waveform and the measured waveform This difference is called the error vector Before calculating the EVM the measured waveform is corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency offset Then the carrier leakage  shall be removed from the measured waveform before calculating the EVM

The measured waveform is further modified by selecting the absolute phase and absolute amplitude of the Tx chain The EVM result is defined after the frontend IDFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a 

The basic EVM measurement interval in the time domain is one preamble sequence for the PRACH and is one slot for the PUCCH and PUSCH in the time domain When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS the EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol accordingly The PUSCH or PUCCH EVM measurement interval is also reduced when the mean power modulation or allocation between slots is expected to change In the case of PUSCH transmission the measurement interval is reduced by a time interval equal to the sum of 5 ¦Ìs and the applicable exclusion period defined in subclause 63X adjacent to the boundary where the power change is expected to occur For DFTspread PUSCH the  exclusion period is applied to the signal obtained after the frontend IDFT In the case of PUCCH transmission with power change the PUCCH EVM measurement interval is reduced by one symbol adjacent to the boundary where the power change is expected to occur

6422	Carrier leakage

Carrier leakage is an additive sinusoid waveform whose frequency is the same as the modulated waveform carrier frequency The measurement interval is one slot in the time domain

In the case that uplink sharing the carrier leakage may have 75kHz shift with the carrier frequency

6423	Inband emissions

The inband emission is defined as the average emission across 12 subcarriers and as a function of the RB offset from the edge of the allocated UL transmission bandwidth The inband emission is measured as the ratio of the UE output power in a nonallocated RB to the UE output power in an allocated RB

The basic inband emissions measurement interval is defined over one slot in the time domain however the minimum requirement applies when the inband emission measurement is averaged over 10 subframes When the PUSCH or PUCCH transmission slot is shortened due to multiplexing with SRS the inband emissions measurement interval is reduced by one or more symbols accordingly

6424	EVM equalizer spectrum flatness

The zeroforcing equalizer correction applied in the EVM measurement process as described in Annex F must meet a spectral flatness requirement for the EVM measurement to be valid The EVM equalizer spectrum flatness is defined in terms of the maximum peaktopeak ripple of the equalizer coefficients dB across the allocated uplink block The basic measurement interval is the same as for EVM

Note 2 These requirements also apply for the frequency ranges that are less than FOOB MHz in Table 65311 and Table xxxxx from the edge of the channel bandwidth





654	Transmit intermodulation

The transmit intermodulation performance is a measure of the capability of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in its non linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna

UE transmit intermodulation is defined by the ratio of the mean power of the wanted signal to the mean power of the intermodulation product when an interfering CW signal is added at a level below the wanted signal at each transmitter antenna port with the other antenna ports if any terminated Both the wanted signal power and the intermodulation product power are measured through NR rectangular filter with measurement bandwidth shown in Table 6541

The requirement of transmit intermodulation is specified in Table 6541
